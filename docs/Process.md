# Process Class Documentation

The `Process` class encapsulates information about a system process, providing details such as the process ID (`pid`) and executable information. Additionally, it includes methods to retrieve and manage network connections associated with the process.

## Class: `Process`

The `Process` class is designed to represent a system process with the following attributes:

- `pid`: The process ID, a unique identifier for the running process.
- `executable`: The name of the executable associated with the process.

### Methods:

#### `__post_init__(self) -> None`:

This method is called after the data class is initialized. It uses the process ID to query information about the process, specifically its executable name and executable with arguments. The information is obtained by running `ps` commands via subprocess calls. If successful, the attributes `executable` and `executable_with_args` are updated accordingly.

#### `as_dict(self) -> dict[str, Any]`:

This property returns a dictionary representation of the `Process` instance, including the process ID and executable information.

#### `get_connections_of_the_process(process, connections=None) -> dict`:

This static method retrieves network connections associated with a given process. It takes a `Process` object as an argument and, optionally, a list of network connections. If the list of connections is not provided, it calls the `Netstat.get_connections()` method to obtain network connections. The method returns a dictionary containing information about the process and its associated network connections, including the count and details of each connection.

#### `get_connections_of_this_process(self) -> dict`:

This instance method simplifies the retrieval of network connections associated with the current process. It internally calls the static method `get_connections_of_the_process` and returns the resulting dictionary.

### Usage Example:

```python
# Example usage of the Process class
process_instance = Process(pid=1234)
print("Process Information:", process_instance.as_dict())

connections_info = process_instance.get_connections_of_this_process()
print("Connections of the Process:", connections_info)
```

### Notes:

- The class relies on external commands executed through the `subprocess` module to obtain information about the process and its associated network connections.
- There are placeholders (`#TODO` comments) in the code indicating areas where future improvements or changes are suggested.
- The class follows the data class pattern, utilizing the `@dataclass` decorator for concise attribute definition and initialization.
